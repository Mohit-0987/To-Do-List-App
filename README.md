### ‚ö†Ô∏è A Note on Loading Time

> **This website can take up to 30 seconds to load initially. Please be patient.**

This delay is because the application is hosted on a free-tier service (render). These services put applications to "sleep" after a period of inactivity to conserve resources. The first request will "wake up" the application, causing a one-time startup delay.
