## üñ•Ô∏è Running the Project Locally

To run this application on your local machine, follow these steps.

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git](https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git)
    cd your-repo-name
    ```

2.  **Create and Activate a Python Virtual Environment:**
    * **On macOS/Linux:**
        ```bash
        python3 -m venv venv
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```
    * **On Windows:**
        ```bash
        python -m venv venv
        .\venv\Scripts\activate
        ```

3.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Set Up Environment Variables for Vercel KV:**
    To connect to your Vercel KV database locally, you need to pull the environment variables from your Vercel project. First, install the Vercel CLI:
    ```bash
    npm install -g vercel
    ```
    Then log in and link your project:
    ```bash
    vercel login
    vercel link
    ```
    Finally, pull the environment variables into a `.env` file:
    ```bash
    vercel env pull .env.local
    ```
    The `vercel-kv` library will automatically use these variables.

5.  **Run the Flask App:**
    ```bash
    flask run
    ```

6.  **View in Browser:**
    Open your web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000`. You should see the application running and connected to your cloud database.
